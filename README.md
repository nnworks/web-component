# \<web-component\>

Basic web component setup.



Folder structure:

Within src folder (to keep the editor happy):
- scss compiling into css (.scss files from scss/ to .css files in css/ directory)
- scss styles in html into inline css (.html files from html/ to .html in

When building to release/build folder:
- modifying path on build (relative to other node_modules)
- babel transpiling
